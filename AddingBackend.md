# Adding Another Backend to the Scoreboard

To add another backend to the scoreboard, simply modify the Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/Ac2zoom/dockerfiles/blob/scoreboard/onnx-docker/onnx-docker-cpu/Dockerfile) to also install the relevant framework and backend.  Once this is done, add a call to pytest for the relevant test (subclass of [onnx.backend.test](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/onnx/backend/test)) to [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Ac2zoom/onnx-backend-scoreboard/blob/master/.travis.yml).  Ensure that, before this test is run, `export BACKEND='<backend name>'` is added to the travis command in the Docker container before pytest is called.  This will ensure that the correct files are written.  Once this is done, the Travis CI will automatically generate the correct files and write to both the README and the CSV files rendered by the GitHub Page.
